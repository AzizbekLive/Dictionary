# Dictionary
This Dictionary app is a simple yet functional Android application that I developed during my learning journey at GITA Academy. It serves as a personal project that allowed me to gain hands-on experience with Android app development and database management using SQLite. This app functions as a basic English-Uzbek translator, making it a useful tool
